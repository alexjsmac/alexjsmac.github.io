Starting off in Thunder Bay, Ontario I grew up with a keen passion for all things related to music and technology. Initally an aspiring musician, as the years passed I found myself not only playing in bands but also recording them. Then after high school I moved to southern Ontario and began becoming more and more interested in the actual software applications and hardware that are a part of audio production.

As I travel down the path of finding my perfect niche I continue to pursue these areas of interest with various projects and people.

For music recordings check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/xanderjohnscott) page, for programming projects head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/amaclean199), and if it's my professional experience you're interested in then please connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-maclean-ba018543).
