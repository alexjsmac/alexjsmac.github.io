Originally I'm from Thunder Bay, ON and graduated from Fanshawe College's Music Industry Arts program before getting an HBSc in Computer Science from Western University.

The intersection of sound and technology is really what I'm about. From there, things stem out into sub-genres such as machine learning and ecology.

I also like to run and enjoy the odd video game...
