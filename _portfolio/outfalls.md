"Outfalls" delves into the intricate pathways of wastewater within local water basins, navigating the convergence of 
stormwater and sewage systems. This project orchestrates an experimental electronic composition that echoes the 
interconnectedness of these vital infrastructures. Through original photography skillfully manipulated by AI, a visual 
narrative emerges, shedding light on the often-overlooked facets of our ecosystem. The live coding performance serves 
as a dynamic centerpiece, symbolizing the harmonious interplay between technology and nature. "Outfalls" endeavors to 
initiate dialogues on the symbiotic relationship between urban infrastructure and natural water cycles, fostering 
contemplation on environmental interconnectedness.

BluHeron Collective, consisting of artists Christopher McLeod and Alex MacLean, is an open collective exploring sonic 
art through new technologies and modes of engagement. Their explorations intertwine realms of augmented and virtual 
reality infused with physicality through sonic landscapes. BluHeron invites audiences into transformative journeys 
through sound and immersive mediums. Weaving innovative technology and live performance, the collective creates 
alternative reflections on contemporary social and environmental topics in an attempt to spark meaningful dialogues 
and provoke contemplation.
