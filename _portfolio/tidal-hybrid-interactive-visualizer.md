A controllable audio visualizer with input from a webcam.

Music was created by first recording some snippets with [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), then bringing them into Pro Tools for additional production work.

Visuals were created with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Check out the live version [here](https://www.alexmaclean.ca/tidal-hybrid-interactive-visualizer/).

And the code for this project can be found in this GitHub [repo](https://github.com/amaclean199/tidal-hybrid-interactive-visualizer).
