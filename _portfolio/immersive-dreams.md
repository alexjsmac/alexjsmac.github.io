Immersive Dreams is an interactive virtual reality sound installation that aims to break open VR into more of a communal activity. A participant wearing the VR headset interacts with objects in their virtual world and as they do, the multiple displays, and loudspeakers in the room respond to their actions accordingly, allowing audience members to join the participant in their exploration of the virtual space.
