This project aimed to break apart the isolation of VR and share an experience between both the wearer of a headset and a room of observers. It presented the user with an acoustically playable virtual environment in which their interactions with objects spawned audio events from the room’s 80 loudspeakers and animations on the room’s 3 display walls. This required the use of several Unity game engines running on separate machines and SuperCollider running as the audio engine. The perspectives into what the wearer of the headset was doing allowed the audience to connect their movements to the sounds and images being experienced, effectively allowing them all to participate in the installation simultaneously.
