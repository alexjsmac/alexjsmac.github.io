6-channel sound installation inspired by the [situation](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/parkview-pollution-industry-merulla-1.5246736) between Hamilton's Parkview residents and the intruding sounds of the nearby recycling plants. Wind energy influences the movement of a piece of material that hovers over a photosensor. When the sensor detects a low light level it sends a signal to the software to play the bell sounds. Occasionally this pattern is swept away by the warped sounds of scrap yards taking over the soundscape. A generative pattern on a synth pad plays continually in the background.
