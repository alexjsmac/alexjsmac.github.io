The Digital Harp Chair is an interactive art installation that transforms a piece of furniture into an expressive musical 
instrument. By merging classic design with modern technology, this project invites users to create music through the 
simple act of touch.

The chair features two harp-shaped armrests, each strung with touch-sensitive aluminum bars. When a user sits down and 
runs their hands over the bars, they trigger a series of musical notes, much like playing a real harp. This intuitive 
interface makes musical expression accessible to everyone, regardless of their musical background.

### Features & Functionality

The chair is more than just a simple instrument; it's a complete sound-sculpting station. Integrated controls, located 
discreetly on the top of the harp armrests, allow the user to customize their sound in real-time.

* Touch-Sensitive "Strings": The core of the instrument, six aluminum bars on each armrest act as capacitive touch sensors 
to play notes.
* Octave Control: Users can shift the pitch up or down, expanding the chair's musical range.
* Volume Control: The overall volume can be easily adjusted.
* Effects Control: A dedicated sensor allows for the application of various audio effects, adding depth and character to 
the music.

### Technical Implementation
At the heart of the Digital Harp Chair is a Bela microcontroller, renowned for its ultra-low latency audio and sensor 
processing capabilities. This ensures a responsive and seamless musical experience with no noticeable delay between 
touch and sound.

The entire system is powered by custom C++ code, which handles everything from processing the capacitive touch inputs 
to synthesizing the audio output. The electronics, including the Bela board and a speaker system, are neatly housed 
underneath the chair.

### Design and Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort, designed and fabricated by the talented students at Holy Cross Catholic 
Secondary School with guidance and support from Museum London. The result is a unique fusion of art, design, and 
technology, showcasing how creative collaboration can produce truly innovative and engaging experiences. The back of 
the chair features an engraved panel proudly displaying the "HCC ART TECH" contribution.
