An extension of the original [Oceanic "Datanimism"](https://www.alexmaclean.ca/portfolio/oceanic-datanimism/), this experiment brought the idea into VR.

The [A-Frame web framework](https://aframe.io/) was used to create the visuals. The music was created with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). Audio samples under a creative commons license were found on [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).

The global mean sea level rise from 1880 to 2020 was sonified with the data from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sea-level-rise?country=~OWID_WRL).

A HUGE thanks to the Canada Arts Council for supporting this creative research project.

Plug in a VR headset to experience this piece as it's meant to be by checking out the live version [here](https://www.alexmaclean.ca/oceanic-datanimism-vr/). (But you can also view it on Chrome without a headset)
