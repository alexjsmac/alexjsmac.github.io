"Modular Grove" is a VR sound installation that explores the immersive potential of virtual reality and modular 
synthesis to create a multi-sensory experience of the forest. The installation combines cutting-edge VR technology with 
modular synths to create an interactive sonic landscape that responds to users' movements and interactions. In this 
virtual world, users can wander through a dense forest of towering trees, birds chirping and leaves rustling, while 
surrounded by the dynamic soundscapes of both modular and software synths. The installation creates a unique space for 
exploration and discovery, offering viewpoints into the virtual space to spectators in the room as well. Through its use 
of innovative technology, "Modular Grove" invites visitors to engage with the forest in a way that is both immersive and 
transformative, offering a new perspective on the possibilities of digital art and soundscapes.
