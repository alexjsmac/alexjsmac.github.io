Phytoplankton are the primary producers of the aquatic world. All marine life would not exist without them. Their livelihood is dependent on the right combination of nutrients in their ecosystems. Not enough and they perish, but too many nutrients can result in harmful algal blooms that can cause great damage to marine life as well as humans. This piece aims to demonstrate the delicate balance between phytoplankton populations, nutrient levels, and human activity through an immersive sound art experience.

Audio was done with Pure Data, visuals were done with Processing.
