Starting off in Thunder Bay, Ontario I grew up with a keen passion for all things related to music and technology. As the years passed I found myself not only playing in bands but also recording them. Then after high school I moved to southern Ontario and began becoming more and more interested in the actual software applications that are involved with the music industry. As I travel down the path of finding my perfect niche I continue to pursue these areas of interest with various projects and people.

For music recordings check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/xanderjohnscott) page and for programming projects head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/amaclean199).
